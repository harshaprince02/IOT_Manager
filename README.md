The provided code is a Python program for managing IoT devices and includes several functionalities. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. Database Setup
setup_database: Creates an SQLite database named iot_devices.db with a table for storing IoT device information such as name, IP, MAC address, vendor, model, and version.
save_device: Saves details of a device to the database.
delete_device: Deletes a device from the database using its MAC address.
list_saved_devices: Fetches and returns all devices stored in the database.
2. Connected Device Scanning
get_filtered_devices: Scans for connected devices in a specified subnet using the arp command and filters them based on their IP addresses.
3. Packet Capture
capture_packets: Uses the Scapy library to capture a specified number of packets on a given network interface. The packets are saved to a file, and statistics like data rate and total data captured are displayed.
4. Display Network Interfaces
list_interfaces: Lists all available network interfaces on the system along with their MAC addresses.
5. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
detect_intrusions: Monitors network traffic on a given interface for suspicious activity, such as port scans, ping floods, or ARP packets. It analyzes packets in real-time and flags potential intrusions.
6. Additional Features
scan_device_vulnerabilities: Scans a device's open ports and services using the nmap tool to identify potential vulnerabilities.
monitor_traffic: Continuously monitors network traffic and logs a summary of each packet.
7. Main Application
A menu-driven interface allows users to:
List connected devices.
Save or delete devices from the database.
View or export stored devices to a CSV file.
Capture packets or monitor network traffic.
Run an intrusion detection system.
Scan for vulnerabilities.
Exit the application.
Core Libraries Used:
subprocess: Executes system commands for tasks like scanning connected devices or running nmap.
sqlite3: Manages the database.
Scapy: Handles network packet operations.
matplotlib: Imported but not used; likely for visualization.
csv: Exports device data to CSV files.
